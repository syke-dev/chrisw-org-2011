          <h1> Overview </h1>
        
          <p>Blood Tide is a multiplayer, online, action, real-time strategy game for the PC. 
          The game allows players to experience both the strategic management of an army in command mode 
          and the fast-paced, action-packed combat on the battlefield alongside other troops in field mode.</p>
          
          <h1> Gameplay </h1>
          
          <p>Blood Tide is an online multiplayer game that pits two players against each other. 
          Each player takes control of either the Human or Piscivian faction. 
          Players are able to play two unique roles: tactical-commander and field-commander. 
          As the tactical-commander, the player controls units and constructs buildings, 
          like a real-time strategy game. As the field-commander, 
          the player takes the role of one unit on the field and battles alongside the other units. 
          This role plays like an action game with a third-person chase camera. 
          The player can switch between the two roles to better utilize the functions of the tactical-commander and field-commander.</p>
