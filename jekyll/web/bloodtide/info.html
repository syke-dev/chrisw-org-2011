        <h2> Background </h2>
        
        <p>War on Earth has rendered its surface uninhabitable for the human race. 
        In order to preserve themselves, humans have moved to the depths of the ocean and established new colonies. 
        However, the Humans' fight for survival is threatening the delicate ecosystem, which an ancient aquatic-human race, 
        known as Piscivian, has survived within for millennia. 
        The limited underwater resources make it impossible to share the sea, thus the two factions are gearing up for battle -- 
        a battle that will determine which race will thrive and which will become a memory.</p>

        <h2> Gameplay </h2>
        
        <p>At the start of a game session, each faction has three headquarters. 
        These headquarters act as spawning points for different types of units. 
        The units can then be controlled by the player in tactical-commander mode in a similar way to other RTS games. 
        In addition to spawning units, the headquarters can be further specialized by building farms, training grounds, and guard towers around them. 
        Headquarters and buildings can be attacked by enemy units and field-commanders. 
        When a faction loses all three of its headquarters, that faction loses the game.</p>

        <h2> Tactical-Commander Mode </h2>
        
        <p>The tactical-commander is played similar to an RTS game with a bird's eye view.
        When the game begins, the player starts in the tactical-commander role. 
        As the tactical-commander, the player has the ability to issue orders to units and construct buildings. 
        The orders that can be issued are: move to position, attack to position, or attack enemy unit.  
        From this role the player can enter the field-commander role and will be returned to this role if the player's field-commander is killed.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to issuing orders, the player can also build three types of buildings: gaurd tower, farm and armory. 
        The tactical-commander must strategically construct buildings to strengthen the faction's units and protect his or her bases.</p>

        </div>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2> Field-Commander Mode </h2>
        
        <p>The field-commander is played like an action game with a third-person chase camera.  
        At the start of the game session, the player has the ability to choose which type of field-commander to play as. 
        Each headquarters will spawn a different type of field-commander that coincides with the regular units that spawn from that headquarters. 
        If a player wishes to change to a different field-commander type, the player must move the field-commander back to any friendly headquarters.</p>
        
        <p>All units and the field-commander will start with one attack. For instance, both a unit and field-commander turtle will start off with the <i>wave cannon</i> ability;
        however, only the field-commander is capable of unlocking the next two abilities for the unit type. These abilities are unlocked for the field-commander upon promotion, 
        which are <i>shell barrier</i> and <i>bite</i> for the turtle commander. 
        When a training facility is built, both the field-commander and the normal units of that type will be upgraded.</p>
